ACL Config

ACLs are configured under the 'acls' configuration block. The acls block
contains a dictionary of individual acls each keyed by its name.

Each acl contains a list of rules, a packet will have the first matching rule
applied to it.

Each rule is a dictionary containing the single key 'rule' with the value the
matches and actions for the rule.

The matches are key/values based on the ryu RESTFul API.
The key 'actions' contains a dictionary with keys/values as follows:

 * allow (int): if 1 allow the packet to continue through the Faucet \
       pipeline, if 0 drop the packet.
 * force_port_vlan (int): if 1, do not verify the VLAN/port association \
       for this packet and override any VLAN ACL on the forced VLAN.
 * meter (str): meter to apply to the packet
 * output (dict): used to output a packet directly. details below.
 * cookie (int): set flow cookie to this value on this flow

The output action contains a dictionary with the following elements:

 * port (int or string): the port to output the packet to
 * ports (list): a list of the ports (int or string) to output the packet to
 * set_fields (list): a list of fields to set with values
 * dl_dst (str): old style request to set eth_dst to a value (set_fields recommended)
 * pop_vlans: (int): pop the packet vlan before outputting
 * vlan_vid: (int): push the vlan vid on the packet when outputting
 * vlan_vids: (list): push the list of vlans on the packet when outputting, with option eth_type
 * swap_vid (int): rewrite the vlan vid of the packet when outputting
 * failover (dict): Output with a failover port (experimental)
